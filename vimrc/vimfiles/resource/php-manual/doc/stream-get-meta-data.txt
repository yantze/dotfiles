stream_get_meta_data -- Retrieves header/meta data from streams/file pointers

  array stream_get_meta_data(resource stream)~

Returns information about an existing {stream}.

{stream} The stream can be any stream created by |fopen|, |fsockopen| and
|pfsockopen|.

The result array contains the following items:

timed_out (bool) - TRUE if the stream timed out while waiting for data on the
last call to |fread| or |fgets|.

blocked (bool) - TRUE if the stream is in blocking IO mode. See
|stream_set_blocking|.

eof (bool) - TRUE if the stream has reached end-of-file. Note that for socket
streams this member can be TRUE even when unread_bytes is non-zero. To
determine if there is more data to be read, use |feof| instead of reading this
item.

unread_bytes (int) - the number of bytes currently contained in the PHP's own
internal buffer.

You shouldn't use this value in a script.

stream_type (string) - a label describing the underlying implementation of the
stream.

wrapper_type (string) - a label describing the protocol wrapper implementation
layered over the stream. See for more information about wrappers.

wrapper_data (mixed) - wrapper specific data attached to this stream. See for
more information about wrappers and their wrapper data.

filters (array) - and array containing the names of any filters that have been
stacked onto this stream. Documentation on filters can be found in the Filters
appendix.

mode (string) - the type of access required for this stream (see Table 1 of
the fopen() reference)

seekable (bool) - whether the current stream can be seeked.

uri (string) - the URI/filename associated with this stream.

Version Description 5.0.0 The following entries were added in the returned
array: mode, seekable, and uri. 4.3.0 The following entries were added in the
returned array: stream_type, wrapper_type, wrapper_data, and filters. 4.3.0
|socket_get_status| is an alias for this function. Prior to PHP 4.3.0, it was
used to retrieve the first four items, for socket based streams only.

This function does NOT work on sockets created by the Socket extension.
