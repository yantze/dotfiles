oci_set_prefetch -- Sets number of rows to be prefetched

  bool oci_set_prefetch(resource statement, int rows)~

Sets the number of rows to be prefetched after successful call to
|oci_execute|.

{statement}

{rows}

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocisetprefetch| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_set_prefetch| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
