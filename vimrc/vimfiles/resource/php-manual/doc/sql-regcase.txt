sql_regcase -- Make regular expression for case insensitive match

  string sql_regcase(string string)~

Creates a regular expression for a case insensitive match.

{string} The input string.

Returns a valid regular expression which will match {string}, ignoring case.
This expression is {string} with each alphabetic character converted to a
bracket expression; this bracket expression contains that character's
uppercase and lowercase form. Other characters remain unchanged.

|sql_regcase| example

<?php >
  echo sql_regcase("Foo - bar.");
?>

The above example will output:

  [Ff][Oo][Oo] - [Bb][Aa][Rr].



This can be used to achieve case insensitive pattern matching in products
which support only case sensitive regular expressions.

As of PHP 5.3.0 the regex extension is deprecated, calling this function will
issue an E_DEPRECATED notice.
