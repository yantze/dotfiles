unpack -- Unpack data from binary string

  array unpack(string format, string data)~

Unpacks from a binary string into an array according to the given {format}.

|unpack| works slightly different from Perl as the unpacked data is stored in
an associative array. To accomplish this you have to name the different format
codes and separate them by a slash /.

{format} See |pack| for an explanation of the format codes.

{data} The packed data.

Returns an associative array containing unpacked elements of binary string.

|unpack| example

<?php >
  $array = unpack("c2chars/nint", $binarydata);
?>

The resulting array will contain the entries "chars1", "chars2" and "int".





Note that PHP internally stores integral values as signed. If you unpack a
large unsigned long and it is of the same size as PHP internally stored values
the result will be a negative number even though unsigned unpacking was
specified.
