db2_commit -- Commits a transaction

  bool db2_commit(resource connection)~

Commits an in-progress transaction on the specified connection resource and
begins a new transaction. PHP applications normally default to AUTOCOMMIT
mode, so |db2_commit| is not necessary unless AUTOCOMMIT has been turned off
for the connection resource.

If the specified connection resource is a persistent connection, all
transactions in progress for all applications using that persistent connection
will be committed. For this reason, persistent connections are not recommended
for use in applications that require transactions.

{connection} A valid database connection resource variable as returned from
|db2_connect| or |db2_pconnect|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|db2_autocommit| |db2_rollback|
