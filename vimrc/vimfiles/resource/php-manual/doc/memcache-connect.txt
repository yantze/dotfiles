Memcache::connect -- Open memcached server connection

  bool Memcache::connect(string host [, int port [, int timeout]])~

|Memcache::connect| establishes a connection to the memcached server. The
connection, which was opened using |Memcache::connect| will be automatically
closed at the end of script execution. Also you can close it with
|Memcache::close|. Also you can use |memcache_connect| function.

{host} Point to the host where memcached is listening for connections. This
parameter may also specify other transports like
unix:///path/to/memcached.sock to use UNIX domain sockets, in this case {port}
must also be set to 0.

{port} Point to the port where memcached is listening for connections. Set
this parameter to 0 when using UNIX domain sockets.

{timeout} Value in seconds which will be used for connecting to the daemon.
Think twice before changing the default value of 1 second - you can lose all
the advantages of caching if your connection is too slow.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
