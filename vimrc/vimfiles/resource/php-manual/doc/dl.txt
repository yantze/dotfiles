dl -- Loads a PHP extension at runtime

  int dl(string library)~

Loads the PHP extension given by the parameter {library}.

Use |extension_loaded| to test whether a given extension is already available
or not. This works on both built-in extensions and dynamically loaded ones
(either through php.ini or |dl|).

{library} This parameter is only the filename of the extension to load which
also depends on your platform. For example, the sockets extension (if compiled
as a shared module, not the default!) would be called sockets.so on Unix
platforms whereas it is called php_sockets.dll on the Windows platform.

The directory where the extension is loaded from depends on your platform:

Windows - If not explicitly set in the php.ini, the extension is loaded from
c:\php4\extensions\ by default.

Unix - If not explicitly set in the php.ini, the default extension directory
depends on whether PHP has been built with --enable-debug or not

whether PHP has been built with (experimental) ZTS (Zend Thread Safety)
support or not

the current internal ZEND_MODULE_API_NO (Zend internal module API number,
which is basically the date on which a major module API change happened, e.g.
20010901)
