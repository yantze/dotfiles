fseek -- Seeks on a file pointer

  int fseek(resource handle, int offset [, int whence])~

Sets the file position indicator for the file referenced by {handle}. The new
position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file, is obtained by
adding {offset} to the position specified by {whence}.

{handle} A file system pointer resource that is typically created using
|fopen|.

{offset} The offset.

To move to a position before the end-of-file, you need to pass a negative
value in {offset}.

{whence} {whence} values are: SEEK_SET - Set position equal to {offset} bytes.
SEEK_CUR - Set position to current location plus {offset}. SEEK_END - Set
position to end-of-file plus {offset}.

If {whence} is not specified, it is assumed to be SEEK_SET.

Upon success, returns 0; otherwise, returns -1. Note that seeking past EOF is
not considered an error.

|fseek| example

<?php >
  $fp = fopen('somefile.txt', 'r');
  
  // read some data
  $data = fgets($fp, 4096);
  
  // move back to the beginning of the file
  // same as rewind($fp);
  fseek($fp, 0);
?>





If you have opened the file in append ("a" or "a+") mode, any data you write
to the file will always be appended, regardless of the file position.

May not be used on file pointers returned by |fopen| if they use the "http://"
or "ftp://" formats. |fseek| gives also undefined results for append-only
streams (opened with "a" flag).

|ftell| |rewind|
