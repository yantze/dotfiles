oci_pconnect -- Connect to an Oracle database using a persistent connection

  resource oci_pconnect(string username, string password [, string db [, string charset [, int session_mode]]])~

Creates a persistent connection to an Oracle server and logs on.

Persistent connections are cached and re-used between requests, resulting in
reduced overhead on each page load; a typical PHP application will have a
single persistent connection open against an Oracle server per Apache child
process (or PHP FastCGI/CGI process). See the Persistent Database Connections
section for more information.

{username} The Oracle user name.

{password} The password for {username}.

{db} This optional parameter can either contain the name of the local Oracle
instance or the name of the entry in tnsnames.ora.

If the not specified, PHP uses environment variables ORACLE_SID and TWO_TASK
to determine the name of local Oracle instance and location of tnsnames.ora
accordingly.
