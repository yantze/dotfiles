microtime -- Return current Unix timestamp with microseconds

  mixed microtime([bool get_as_float])~

|microtime| returns the current Unix timestamp with microseconds. This
function is only available on operating systems that support the
gettimeofday() system call.

{get_as_float} When called without the optional argument, this function
returns the string "msec sec" where sec is the current time measured in the
number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (0:00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT), and msec
is the microseconds part. Both portions of the string are returned in units of
seconds.

If the optional {get_as_float} is set to TRUE then a float (in seconds) is
returned.

Version Description 5.0.0 The {get_as_float} parameter was added.

Timing script execution with |microtime|

<?php >
  /**
   * Simple function to replicate PHP 5 behaviour
   */
  function microtime_float()
  {
      list($usec, $sec) = explode(" ", microtime());
      return ((float)$usec + (float)$sec);
  }
  
  $time_start = microtime_float();
  
  // Sleep for a while
  usleep(100);
  
  $time_end = microtime_float();
  $time = $time_end - $time_start;
  
  echo "Did nothing in $time seconds\n";
?>



Timing script execution in PHP 5

<?php >
  $time_start = microtime(true);
  
  // Sleep for a while
  usleep(100);
  
  $time_end = microtime(true);
  $time = $time_end - $time_start;
  
  echo "Did nothing in $time seconds\n";
?>
