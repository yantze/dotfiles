win32_query_service_status -- Queries the status of a service

  mixed win32_query_service_status(string servicename [, string machine])~

Queries the current status for a service, returning an array of information.

{servicename} The short name of the service.

{machine} The optional machine name. If omitted, the local machine will be
used.

Returns FALSE on failure, otherwise returns an array consisting of the
following information:

{ServiceType} The dwServiceType.

{CurrentState} The dwCurrentState.

{ControlsAccepted} Which service controls are accepted by the service.

{Win32ExitCode} If the service exited, the return code from the process.

{ServiceSpecificExitCode} If the service exited with an error condition, the
service specific code that is logged in the event log is visible here.

{CheckPoint} If the service is shutting down, holds the current check point
number. This is used by the SCM as a kind of heart-beat to detect a wedged
service process. The value of the check point is best interpreted in
conjunction with the WaitHint value.

{WaitHint} If the service is shutting down it will set WaitHint to a
checkpoint value that will indicate 100% completion. This can be used to
implement a progress indicator.

{ProcessId} The Windows process identifier. If 0, the process is not running.

{ServiceFlags} The dwServiceFlags.
