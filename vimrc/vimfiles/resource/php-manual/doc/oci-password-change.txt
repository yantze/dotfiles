oci_password_change -- Changes password of Oracle's user

  bool oci_password_change(resource connection, string username, string old_password, string new_password)~

  resource oci_password_change(resource connection, string username, string old_password, string new_password, string dbname, string username, string old_password, string new_password)~

Changes password for user with {username}.

{connection} An Oracle connection identifier, returned by |oci_connect| or
|oci_pconnect|.

{username} The Oracle user name.

{old_password} The old password.

{new_password} The new password to be set.

{dbname} The database name.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

The second |oci_password_change| syntax is available since version 1.1.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocipasswordchange| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_password_change| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
