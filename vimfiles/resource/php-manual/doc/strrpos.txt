strrpos -- Find position of last occurrence of a char in a string

  int strrpos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset])~

Returns the numeric position of the last occurrence of {needle} in the
{haystack} string. Note that the needle in this case can only be a single
character in PHP 4. If a string is passed as the needle, then only the first
character of that string will be used.

If {needle} is not found, returns FALSE.

It is easy to mistake the return values for "character found at position 0"
and "character not found". Here's how to detect the difference:

<?php >
  // in PHP 4.0.0 and newer:
  $pos = strrpos($mystring, "b");
  if ($pos === false) { // note: three equal signs
      // not found...
  }
  
  // in versions older than 4.0.0:
  $pos = strrpos($mystring, "b");
  if (is_bool($pos) && !$pos) {
      // not found...
  }
?>

If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the
ordinal value of a character.

As of PHP 5.0.0 {offset} may be specified to begin searching an arbitrary
number of characters into the string. Negative values will stop searching at
an arbitrary point prior to the end of the string.

The {needle} may be a string of more than one character as of PHP 5.0.0.

{haystack}

{needle}

{offset}
