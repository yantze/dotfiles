oci_new_connect -- Establishes a new connection to the Oracle server

  resource oci_new_connect(string username, string password [, string db [, string charset [, int session_mode]]])~

Establishes a new connection to an Oracle server and logs on.

Unlike |oci_connect| and |oci_pconnect|, |oci_new_connect| does not cache
connections and will always return a brand-new freshly opened connection
handle. This is useful if your application needs transactional isolation
between two sets of queries.

{username} The Oracle user name.

{password} The password for {username}.

{db} This optional parameter can either contain the name of the local Oracle
instance or the name of the entry in tnsnames.ora.

If the not specified, PHP uses environment variables ORACLE_SID and TWO_TASK
to determine the name of local Oracle instance and location of tnsnames.ora
accordingly.
