flush -- Flush the output buffer

  void flush()~

Flushes the write buffers of PHP and whatever backend PHP is using (CGI, a web
server, etc). This effectively tries to push all the output so far to the
user's browser.

|flush| has no effect on the buffering scheme of your web server nor the
browser on the client side. And it also doesn't affect PHP's userspace output
buffering mechanism. This means you will have to call both |ob_flush| and
|flush| to flush the ob output buffers.

Several servers, especially on Win32, will still buffer the output from your
script until it terminates before transmitting the results to the browser.

Server modules for Apache like mod_gzip may do buffering of their own that
will cause |flush| to not result in data being sent immediately to the client.
