uniqid -- Generate a unique ID

  string uniqid([string prefix [, bool more_entropy]])~

Gets a prefixed unique identifier based on the current time in microseconds.

{prefix} Can be useful, for instance, if you generate identifiers
simultaneously on several hosts that might happen to generate the identifier
at the same microsecond.

With an empty {prefix}, the returned string will be 13 characters long. If
{more_entropy} is TRUE, it will be 23 characters.

{more_entropy} If set to TRUE, |uniqid| will add additional entropy (using the
combined linear congruential generator) at the end of the return value, which
should make the results more unique.

Returns the unique identifier, as a string.

If you need a unique identifier or token and you intend to give out that token
to the user via the network (i.e. session cookies), it is recommended that you
use something along these lines:

This will create a 32 character identifier (a 128 bit hex number) that is
extremely difficult to predict. |uniqid| Example

<?php >
  // no prefix
  // works only in PHP 5 and later versions
  $token = md5(uniqid());
  
  // better, difficult to guess
  $better_token = md5(uniqid(mt_rand(), true));
?>





Version Description 5.0.0 The {prefix} parameter was made optional. 4.3.1 The
limit of 114 characters long for {prefix} was raised.

Under Cygwin, the {more_entropy} must be set to TRUE for this function to
work.
