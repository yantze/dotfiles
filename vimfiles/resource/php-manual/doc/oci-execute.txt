oci_execute -- Executes a statement

  bool oci_execute(resource statement [, int mode])~

Executes a previously parsed {statement}.

{statement} A valid OCI statement identifier.

{mode} Allows you to specify the execution mode (default is
OCI_COMMIT_ON_SUCCESS).

If you don't want statements to be committed automatically, you should specify
OCI_DEFAULT as your {mode}.

When using OCI_DEFAULT mode, you're creating a transaction. Transactions are
automatically rolled back when you close the connection, or when the script
ends, whichever is soonest. You need to explicitly call |oci_commit| to commit
the transaction, or |oci_rollback| to abort it.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociexecute| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_execute| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

|oci_parse|
