win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher -- Registers the script with the SCM, so
that it can act as the service with the given name

  mixed win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher(string name)~

When launched via the Service Control Manager, a service process is required
to "check-in" with it to establish service monitoring and communication
facilities. This function performs the check-in by spawning a thread to handle
the lower-level communication with the service control manager.

Once started, the service process should continue to check-in with the service
control manager so that it can determine if it should terminate. This is
achieved by periodically calling |win32_get_last_control_message| and handling
the return code appropriately.

{name} The short-name of the service, as registered by |win32_create_service|.

Returns TRUE on success, otherwise FALSE or a win32 error code.
