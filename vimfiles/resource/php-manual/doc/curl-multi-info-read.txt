curl_multi_info_read -- Get information about the current transfers

  array curl_multi_info_read(resource mh [, int msgs_in_queue])~

Ask the multi handle if there are any messages or information from the
individual transfers. Messages may include information such as an error code
from the transfer or just the fact that a transfer is completed.

Repeated calls to this function will return a new result each time, until a
FALSE is returned as a signal that there is no more to get at this point. The
integer pointed to with {msgs_in_queue} will contain the number of remaining
messages after this function was called.

The data the returned resource points to will not survive calling
|curl_multi_remove_handle|.

{mh} A cURL multi handle returned by |curl_multi_init|.

{msgs_in_queue} Number of messages that are still in the queue

On success, returns an associative array for the message, FALSE on failure.

Version Description 5.2.0 {msgs_in_queue} was added.
