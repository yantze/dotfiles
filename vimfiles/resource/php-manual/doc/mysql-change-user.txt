mysql_change_user -- Change logged in user of the active connection

  int mysql_change_user(string user, string password [, string database [, resource link_identifier]])~

|mysql_change_user| changes the logged in user of the current active
connection, or the connection given by the optional {link_identifier}
parameter. If a database is specified, this will be the current database after
the user has been changed. If the new user and password authorization fails,
the current connected user stays active.

This function is deprecated and no longer exists in PHP.

{user} The new MySQL username.

{password} The new MySQL password.

{database} The MySQL database. If not specified, the current selected database
is used.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

This function requires MySQL 3.23.3 or higher.

|mysql_connect| |mysql_select_db| |mysql_query|
