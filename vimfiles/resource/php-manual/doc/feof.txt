feof -- Tests for end-of-file on a file pointer

  bool feof(resource handle)~

Tests for end-of-file on a file pointer.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
opened by |fopen| or |fsockopen| (and not yet closed by |fclose|).

Returns TRUE if the file pointer is at EOF or an error occurs (including
socket timeout); otherwise returns FALSE.

If a connection opened by |fsockopen| wasn't closed by the server, |feof| will
wait until a timeout has been reached to return TRUE. The default timeout
value is 60 seconds. You may use |stream_set_timeout| to change this value.

If the passed file pointer is not valid you may get an infinite loop, because
|feof| fails to return TRUE. |feof| example with an invalid file pointer

<?php >
  // if file can not be read or doesn't exist fopen function returns FALSE
  $file = @fopen("no_such_file", "r");
  
  // FALSE from fopen will issue warning and result in infinite loop here
  while (!feof($file)) {
  }
  
  fclose($file);
?>
