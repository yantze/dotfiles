fnmatch -- Match filename against a pattern

  bool fnmatch(string pattern, string string [, int flags])~

|fnmatch| checks if the passed {string} would match the given shell wildcard
{pattern}.

{pattern} The shell wildcard pattern.

{string} The tested string. This function is especially useful for filenames,
but may also be used on regular strings.

The average user may be used to shell patterns or at least in their simplest
form to '?' and '*' wildcards so using |fnmatch| instead of |preg_match| for
frontend search expression input may be way more convenient for
non-programming users.

{flags} One of the FNM_XXX constants.

Returns TRUE if there is a match, FALSE otherwise.

Version Description 5.3.0 This function is now available on Windows platforms.

Checking a color name against a shell wildcard pattern

<?php >
  if (fnmatch("*gr[ae]y", $color)) {
    echo "some form of gray ...";
  }
?>





For now this function is not available on non-POSIX compliant systems.

|glob| |preg_match| |sscanf| |printf| |sprintf|
