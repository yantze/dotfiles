fputcsv -- Format line as CSV and write to file pointer

  int fputcsv(resource handle, array fields [, string delimiter [, string enclosure]])~

|fputcsv| formats a line (passed as a {fields} array) as CSV and write it
(terminated by a newline) to the specified file {handle}.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
opened by |fopen| or |fsockopen| (and not yet closed by |fclose|).

{fields} An array of values.

{delimiter} The optional {delimiter} parameter sets the field delimiter (one
character only). Defaults as a comma: ,.

{enclosure} The optional {enclosure} parameter sets the field enclosure (one
character only) and defaults to a double quotation mark: ".

Returns the length of the written string, or FALSE on failure.

|fputcsv| example

<?php >
  $list = array (
      'aaa,bbb,ccc,dddd',
      '123,456,789',
      '"aaa","bbb"'
  );
  
  $fp = fopen('file.csv', 'w');
  
  foreach ($list as $line) {
      fputcsv($fp, split(',', $line));
  }
  
  fclose($fp);
?>





If PHP is not properly recognizing the line endings when reading files either
on or created by a Macintosh computer, enabling the auto_detect_line_endings
run-time configuration option may help resolve the problem.
