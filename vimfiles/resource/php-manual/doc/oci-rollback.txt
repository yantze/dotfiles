oci_rollback -- Rolls back outstanding transaction

  bool oci_rollback(resource connection)~

Rolls back all outstanding statements for the Oracle {connection}.

{connection} An Oracle connection identifier, returned by |oci_connect| or
|oci_pconnect|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Transactions are automatically rolled back when you close the connection, or
when the script ends, whichever is soonest. You need to explicitly call
|oci_commit| to commit the transaction, or |oci_rollback| to abort it.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocirollback| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_rollback| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

|oci_commit|
