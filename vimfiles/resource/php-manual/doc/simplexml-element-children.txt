cannot be viewed using |var_dump| or anything else which can examine objects.

Traversing a children() pseudo-array

<?php >
  $xml = new SimpleXMLElement(
  '<person>
   <child role="son">
    <child role="daughter"/>
   </child>
   <child role="daughter">
    <child role="son">
     <child role="son"/>
    </child>
   </child>
  </person>');
  
  foreach ($xml->children() as $second_gen) {
      echo ' The person begot a ' . $second_gen['role'];
  
      foreach ($second_gen->children() as $third_gen) {
          echo ' who begot a ' . $third_gen['role'] . ';';
  
          foreach ($third_gen->children() as $fourth_gen) {
              echo ' and that ' . $third_gen['role'] .
                  ' begot a ' . $fourth_gen['role'];
          }
      }
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  The person begot a son who begot a daughter; The person
  begot a daughter who begot a son; and that son begot a son
