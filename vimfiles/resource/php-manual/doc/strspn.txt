strspn -- Find length of initial segment matching mask

  int strspn(string str1, string str2 [, int start [, int length]])~

Finds the length of the initial segment matching mask.

The line of code:

<?php >
  $var = strspn("42 is the answer, what is the question ...", "1234567890");
?>

will assign 2 to $var, because the string "42" will be the longest segment
containing characters from "1234567890".

{str1} The first string.

{str2} The second string.

{start} The start position of the string to examine. Negative value counts
position from the end of a string.

{length} The length of the string to examine. Negative value sets length from
the end of a string.

Returns the length of the initial segment of {str1} which consists entirely of
characters in {str2}.

Version Description 4.3.0 The {start} and {length} parameters were added
