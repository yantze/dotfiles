exit -- Output a message and terminate the current script

  void exit([string status])~

  void exit([string status, int status])~

Terminates execution of the script.

{status} If {status} is a string, this function prints the {status} just
before exiting.

If {status} is an integer, that value will also be used as the exit status.
Exit statuses should be in the range 0 to 254, the exit status 255 is reserved
by PHP and shall not be used. The status 0 is used to terminate the program
successfully.

PHP >= 4.2.0 does NOT print the {status} if it is an integer.

No value is returned.

|exit| example

<?php >
  $filename = '/path/to/data-file';
  $file = fopen($filename, 'r')
      or exit("unable to open file ($filename)");
?>





|exit| status example

<?php >
  //exit program normally
  exit;
  exit();
  exit(0);
  
  //exit with an error code
  exit(1);
  exit(0376); //octal
?>





Because this is a language construct and not a function, it cannot be called
using variable functions

This language construct is equivalent to |die|.
