easter_days -- Get number of days after March 21 on which Easter falls for a
given year

  int easter_days([int year [, int method]])~

Returns the number of days after March 21 on which Easter falls for a given
year. If no year is specified, the current year is assumed.

This function can be used instead of |easter_date| to calculate Easter for
years which fall outside the range of Unix timestamps (i.e. before 1970 or
after 2037).

The date of Easter Day was defined by the Council of Nicaea in AD325 as the
Sunday after the first full moon which falls on or after the Spring Equinox.
The Equinox is assumed to always fall on 21st March, so the calculation
reduces to determining the date of the full moon and the date of the following
Sunday. The algorithm used here was introduced around the year 532 by
Dionysius Exiguus. Under the Julian Calendar (for years before 1753) a simple
19-year cycle is used to track the phases of the Moon. Under the Gregorian
Calendar (for years after 1753 - devised by Clavius and Lilius, and introduced
by Pope Gregory XIII in October 1582, and into Britain and its then colonies
in September 1752) two correction factors are added to make the cycle more
accurate.
