strtr -- Translate certain characters

  string strtr(string str, string from, string to)~

  string strtr(string str, string from, string to, string str, array replace_pairs)~

This function returns a copy of {str}, translating all occurrences of each
character in {from} to the corresponding character in {to}.

If {from} and {to} are different lengths, the extra characters in the longer
of the two are ignored.

{str} The string being translated.

{from} The string being translated to {to}.

{to} The string replacing {from}.

{replace_pairs} The {replace_pairs} parameter may be used as a substitute for
{to} and {from} in which case it's an array in the form array('from' => 'to',
...).

This function returns a copy of {str}, translating all occurrences of each
character in {from} to the corresponding character in {to}.

Version Description 4.0.0 The optional {to} and {from} parameters were added.

|strtr| example

<?php >
  $addr = strtr($addr, "äåö", "aao");
?>





|strtr| may be called with only two arguments. If called with two arguments it
behaves in a new way: {from} then has to be an array that contains string ->
string pairs that will be replaced in the source string. |strtr| will always
look for the longest possible match first and will *NOT* try to replace stuff
that it has already worked on.

|strtr| example with two arguments

<?php >
  $trans = array("hello" => "hi", "hi" => "hello");
  echo strtr("hi all, I said hello", $trans);
?>

The above example will output:

  hello all, I said hi
