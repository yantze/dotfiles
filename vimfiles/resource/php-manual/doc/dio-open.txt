dio_open -- Opens a new filename with specified permissions of flags and
creation permissions of mode

  resource dio_open(string filename, int flags [, int mode])~

|dio_open| opens a file and returns a new file descriptor for it.

{filename} The opened file.

{flags} The {flags} parameter can also include any combination of the
following flags: O_CREAT - creates the file, if it doesn't already exist.

O_EXCL - if both, O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set, |dio_open| fails, if the file
already exists.

O_TRUNC - if the file exists, and its opened for write access, the file will
be truncated to zero length.

O_APPEND - write operations write data at the end of the file.

O_NONBLOCK - sets non blocking mode.

{mode} If {flags} is O_CREAT, {mode} will set the mode of the file (creation
permissions). O_RDONLY - opens the file for read access.

O_WRONLY - opens the file for write access.

O_RDWR - opens the file for both reading and writing.

A file descriptor or FALSE on error.
