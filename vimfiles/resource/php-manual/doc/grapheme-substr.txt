grapheme_substr -- Return part of a string

Procedural style

  int grapheme_substr(string string, int start [, int length])~

Return part of a string

{string} The input string. Must be valid UTF-8.

{start} Start position in default grapheme units. If $start is non-negative,
the returned string will start at the $start'th position in $string, counting
from zero. If $start is negative, the returned string will start at the
$start'th grapheme unit from the end of string.

{length} Length in grapheme units. If $length is given and is positive, the
string returned will contain at most $length grapheme units beginning from
$start (depending on the length of string). If $string is less than or equal
to $start grapheme units long, FALSE will be returned. If $length is given and
is negative, then that many grapheme units will be omitted from the end of
string (after the start position has been calculated when a start is
negative). If $start denotes a position beyond this truncation, an empty
string will be returned.

Returns the extracted part of $string.

|grapheme_substr| example

<?php >
  $char_a_ring_nfd = "a\xCC\x8A";  // 'LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE' (U+00E5) normalization form "D"
  $char_o_diaeresis_nfd = "o\xCC\x88"; // 'LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS' (U+00F6) normalization form "D"
  
  print urlencode(grapheme_substr( "ao" . $char_a_ring_nfd . "bc" . $char_o_diaeresis_nfd . "O", 2, -1 ));
?>



The above example will output:



  a%CC%8Abco%CC%88
