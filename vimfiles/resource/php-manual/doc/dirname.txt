dirname -- Returns directory name component of path

  string dirname(string path)~

Given a string containing a path to a file, this function will return the name
of the directory.

{path} A path.

On Windows, both slash (/) and backslash (\) are used as directory separator
character. In other environments, it is the forward slash (/).

Returns the name of the directory. If there are no slashes in {path}, a dot
('.') is returned, indicating the current directory. Otherwise, the returned
string is {path} with any trailing /component removed.

Version Description 5.0.0 |dirname| is now binary safe 4.0.3 |dirname| was
fixed to be POSIX-compliant.

|dirname| example

<?php >
  $path = "/etc/passwd";
  $file = dirname($path); // $file is set to "/etc"
?>





Since PHP 4.3.0, you will often get a slash or a dot back from |dirname| in
situations where the older functionality would have given you the empty
string.

Check the following change example:

<?php >
  //before PHP 4.3.0
  dirname('c:/'); // returned '.'
  
  //after PHP 4.3.0
  dirname('c:/x'); // returns 'c:\'
  dirname('c:/Temp/x'); // returns 'c:/Temp'
  dirname('/x'); // returns '\'
?>

|basename| |pathinfo| |realpath|
