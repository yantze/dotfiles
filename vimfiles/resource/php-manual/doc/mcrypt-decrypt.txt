mcrypt_decrypt -- Decrypts crypttext with given parameters

  string mcrypt_decrypt(string cipher, string key, string data, string mode [, string iv])~

Decrypts the {data} and returns the unencrypted data.

{cipher} {cipher} is one of the MCRYPT_ciphername constants of the name of the
algorithm as string.

{key} {key} is the key with which the data is encrypted. If it's smaller that
the required keysize, it is padded with '\0'.

{data} {data} is the data that will be decrypted with the given cipher and
mode. If the size of the data is not n * blocksize, the data will be padded
with '\0'.

{mode} {mode} is one of the MCRYPT_MODE_modename constants of one of "ecb",
"cbc", "cfb", "ofb", "nofb" or "stream".

{iv} The {iv} parameter is used for the initialisation in CBC, CFB, OFB modes,
and in some algorithms in STREAM mode. If you do not supply an IV, while it is
needed for an algorithm, the function issues a warning and uses an IV with all
bytes set to '\0'.

Returns the decrypted data as a string.
